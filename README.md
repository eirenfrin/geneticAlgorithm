Genetic algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem. The goal is to find a circular path of a given number of cities visiting each city exactly once where the length of the path is minimized. The cities are generated randomly and represented by a pair of coordinates. The cost of travel between two cities is equal to the Euclidean distance between them. The algorithm works under the assumption that there is a path between each pair of cities from the set, and that the prices of a direct and return trip are the same.
Genetic information is represented by a vector that contains the index of each city in some order (some permutation of cities). The fitness of an individual is expressed as the reciprocal of the length of the entire path. Parents are selected using tournament or roulette wheel selection mechanism. The algorithm stops searching after a given number of generations has passed.
